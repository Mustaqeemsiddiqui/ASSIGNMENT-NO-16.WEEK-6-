    "**request** is used in Flask to access incoming request data from clients. It allows us to retrieve form data, query parameters, files, cookies, and other request-related information, enabling us to handle user input and create dynamic web applications.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Reasons** why \"request\" used in flask:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(1)**Accessing Data Sent by the Client\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Form Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "When a client submits a form using POST, the form data can be accessed via request.form.\n",
    "\n",
    "from flask import request\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def submit():\n",
    "    name = request.form['name']\n",
    "    email = request.form['email']\n",
    "    return f'Name: {name}, Email: {email}'\n",
    "    \n",
    "2)Query Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "For data sent via the URL (GET request), query parameters can be accessed using request.args.\n",
    "@app.route('/search')\n",
    "def search():\n",
    "    query = request.args.get('q')\n",
    "    return f'Search query: {query}'\n",

    "    data = request.json\n",
    "    return f'Received data: {data}'\n",
    "\n",
    "4)File Uploads:\n",
    "\n",
    "Files uploaded by the client can be accessed using request.files.\n",

    "You can access the headers sent by the client using request.headers.\n",
